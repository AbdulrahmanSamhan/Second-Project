**- The Journey Begins: Data Exploration**  
I kicked off this project by diving deep into our data, identifying essential **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** such as:  
• Revenue  
• Maintenance Costs  
• Fixed Costs  
• Fuel Cost  
• Goods Value  
• Number of Orders  
• Number of Customers  
• Total KM  
• Fuel Efficiency  
• Truck Efficiency  
• Driver Efficiency  
• Financial Results  
• KM Traveled  
• ATP (Average Truck Price)  
• GM% (Gross Margin Percentage)  

**- Crafting a Dashboard Mockup**  
Next, I transformed these insights into an engaging dashboard mockup.

**- Next Steps: Data Transformation & Analysis**  
We are now initiating the ETL process in Power Query, setting up data model relationships, and performing DAX calculations to drive deeper insights.

**- Dynamic Dashboard Integration**  
By integrating all these components, I built a dynamic, interactive dashboard that highlights valuable trends.

**- Key Insights & Observations**  

1. **Seasonal Revenue Trends**: In January of both years, we saw a concerning dip in revenue along with lower goods value, but an encouraging rebound in February.
  
2. **Quarterly Challenges**: Our analysis identified operational issues in April, May, June, and August 2018, but we successfully turned these around, boosting revenue.

3. **City-Specific Insights**: Mineola City led in revenue in 2018, but unfortunately dropped to 7th in 2019—an area that requires strategic attention.

4. **Cost Efficiency Analysis**: We found the Box Truck to have the lowest overall cost, while the Trailer Truck ranked second. However, for long-haul trips, I recommend the Trailer Truck as it covered 614k km compared to the Box Truck’s 256k km, with only a slight difference in costs.


A heartfelt thanks to Mohamed Abdelatti for his exceptional guidance and unwavering support throughout this project!
